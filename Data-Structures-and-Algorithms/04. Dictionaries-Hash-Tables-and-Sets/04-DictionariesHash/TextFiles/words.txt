You are given a HTTP console server (if you only paid attention to the trainers during the HTTP Fundamentals lecture). It receives HTTP request in text form, parses it and returns HTTP response for the particular request. 
On the first line there is the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), the URI to the resource (/Api/ReturnMe/someParam123) and the HTTP version (in format HTTP/{major}.{minor}) separated by a single space. On the next lines there are the HTTP request headers. Each line represents single header - a name-value pair, separated by :. For example Host: telerikacademy.com is a header with name Host and value telerikacademy.com. There is no restriction on the number of headers. The request ends when there are two new line characters in a row.
Live page with no caching and CORS
On the first line there is the HTTP version, the HTTP status code (200, 404, 500, etc.) and the HTTP status in a human-readable format (OK, BadRequest, etc.) separated by a single space. On the next line there are the HTTP response headers in the same format as the request ones. After the headers there is an empty line after which there is the response body (text in any format: plain, JSON, etc.).
